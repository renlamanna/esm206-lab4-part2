Scatterplot of penguin flipper_length_mm (x-axis) vs body_mass_g (y-axis) with points having different color based on species

# when u want to change something that depends on variable,color for species, must use aes()
# store entire gg plot to name
# if i want it to show up in knitted document, we have to call it back
# penguins_graph

```{r}
penguins_graph <- ggplot(data = penguins, 
       aes(x = flipper_length_mm, y = body_mass_g)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = species))

# Make interactive graph

ggplotly(penguins_graph)
  
```

# create searchable and filterable data table

```{r}
datatable(penguins)
```
